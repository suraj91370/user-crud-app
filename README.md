> "I’ve created a user CRUD application using React and PHP. The frontend is built in React and communicates with a PHP REST API using Axios. Each CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is handled via a specific endpoint in the backend, and responses are returned in JSON format.

> The backend uses MySQL for data storage. I’ve used Git for version control and pushed the code to GitHub. The interviewer can clone the repo, configure the database, and run both frontend and backend locally using XAMPP and `npm start`."
